I was lucky enough to get a ticket to ng-cong in Salt Lake City this year.  It was a great conference, much different from the tech conferences that I'm used to.

# Key Take aways
- Angular 2 is going to be fast 
 - The RC file size has been reduced from 170k to 50k.  
 - Angular CLI will support pre-compilation of templates which will help with both file size and time to initial load.
 - Lazy loading on routes will further help with load times
 - Angular Universal will allow pre-rendering of angular sites on the server (supports Node and asp.net via node)
 - Angular 2 change detection is fast!
- Angular 2 is going to be everywhere
 - Technologies like ionic and native script will allow angular 2 to run on mobile devices
 - Mobile.angular.io  provides tooling for better progressive web applications
 - Angular Universal will allow angular to run on the server 
 - Desktop apps can be created with Electron and Angular 2
- Angular 2 is going to have a huge ecosystem
 - Angular Material is going to provide a rich UI component suite
 - 3rd Party components are coming ([Wijimo](http://wijmo.com/angular2/), [Vaadin](https://vaadin.com/vaadin-documentation-portlet/elements/integrations/angular2.html), [Kendo](http://demos.telerik.com/kendo-ui/integration/angular2), [Ng-bootstrap](https://github.com/ng-bootstrap/core) and others)
- TypeScript all the things
    - TypeScript is going to be the best way to write angular code
    - Consider using TypeScript for any js code
 

# Tips
- Talk with fellow attendees, some of the best information you will get will be from other attendees
- Pre-download workshop files the wi-fi doesn't handle 100 npm install at once very well
- Go early or late for food avoid the lines
- I found it interesting that most presenters were using a Macbook Pro (Apple), angular (Google) and VScode and typescript (Microsoft).  It's nice to see everyone playing nice together.

# Conclusion
Overall I thought this was a very well run conference, my only negative feedback would be that a few of the talks seemed to be duplicating content which doesn't really make sense in a single track conference.
